# Engineering Leader

I am a people-first engineering leader. After years of running a niche software consultancy, I thoroughly enjoyed building and scaling up high-performing teams at Fastly and HashiCorp. I bring a collaborative approach and entrepreneurial spirit to my teams enabling them to deliver products from concept to production. I have a maverick streak and bring an infectious spark to everything I do.

# Advisor, Mentor, Coach

I launched an apprenticeship program in 2013 and have incorporated elements into my teams to help new engineers become productive. I’ve coached staff+ engineers and mentored engineering managers. I run a Mastermind group for engineering directors that provides support and feedback in a small group setting. I mentor entrepreneurs and help them navigate the challenges of launching a business. Nothing makes me happier than seeing them grow and achieve their goals.

# Community Builder

I have spent the last 18 years fostering community to connect, share knowledge, and grow skills. I founded Boulder Ruby in 2006 shortly after moving to Colorado. Not long after, I started organizing conferences creating inclusive and welcoming tech events starting with MountainWest in 2007 and Ruby Mountain Ruby in 2010. I joined Ruby Central as a board member in 2012 to bring the perspective of intimate, welcoming regional conferences to RubyConf and RailsConf, both annual flagship conferences internationally. It’s given me much joy to see how these events have positively changed people’s lives.

# Foodie

I have always had a love for food but it was asleep as I grew up in small-town Kansas. Once my wife introduced me to a variety of world cuisines my interest in food skyrocketed. I am a hobby sourdough baker, pizzaiolo, and all-around cook. My Instagram is primarily “Marty and family make food”. I’ve been known to host way-too-expensive dinners that I call food adventures. Some have nicknamed them “Marty dinners”.
