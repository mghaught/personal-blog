After years as a conference organizer, I am returning to speaking. Much of my thinking has been around engineering leadership and developing talent.

For my first leadership talk, I’m thrilled to be speaking at [LeadDev New York](https://leaddev.com/leaddev-new-york/agenda) this September. I’ll be covering a critical but rarely discussed topic, managing out. This is a fundamental skill for managers but it’s often not done well. It’s uncomfortable and many of us avoid it as long as possible.

My angle in this talk is how to do so humanely and with kindness. Given the times we’re in, I feel we need to be more open and honest about this. I only have 10 minutes so I’m excited for the challenge to distill my message to fit.
